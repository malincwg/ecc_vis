Software for visualization of Eliptic Curve Cryptography algorithms. Requires a CSV of points on an elliptic curve.
Project for my CS480 class, Computational Geomety.

Usage:
python vis.py path_to_ECC_executable [coords_csv] [data_csv]

coords_csv: a csv file of coordinate pairs where the first column is x values and second column is y values. A row is a pair.

data_csv: a csv file containing the elliptic curve function (for now, may include more later)

Dependencies for vis.py: numpy, matplotlib
